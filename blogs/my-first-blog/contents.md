Hey, here's the first blog I have written for this website!

# Why did I switch from using GitHub Pages?
Well, because I also need to do some other stuff that I can't do on GH Pages, like here, dynamic blog view, and it also is applied immediately!

# Why use Server-side Rendering? Why don't use JavaScript client-side?
I'm using SSR because my site does not need to use CSR, as it's more taxing on the client when that client isn't powerful.

I'm also using SSR as it's more supported on **ancient** browsers (but who still uses IE11?), and it's better for the SEO of the site (if this site can be googled lol)
